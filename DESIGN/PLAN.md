=====
The plan for the first coding sprint is to get a very basic way to make and run a game. This will require the environment team to work on two important components. The first is a simple Graphic User Interface to create games. The other is to allow the option to save and load the game which will be handled by the Data team.


The Data team is going to work to get the crucial items of the sprite and game hierarchy down during this first coding sprint. We believe this is critical to get done early to allow the most amount of ease to test features by the other teams. The Data team is also going to configure the XML files that are going to comprise the layout and playstyle of all the games.


Also during this sprint, the Engine team is set out to code the behaviors that all of the Sprites will have when interacting with each other. They will also take care of creating a simple physics engine to calculate the movement of some sprites. The Engine team is going to also need to code up ways to interact with the Game Data XML files.


The Player team is going to work to complete the entire Player interface during the first coding sprint and is planning on joining other teams when it is complete. They plan on returning to the Game Player once the team gets into more of the extensions.


After the first coding sprint is complete, the goal is to work on two of the challenges while finishing up some of the basic components. The Data team will work creating an AI Engine while the other team members work on implementing a Social Center for users. Time Permitting, the group will tackle the possibility of server communication, allowing two user to play with each other on separate computers.
